    "*   **API Key Configuration**: The script loads your API key from a `.env` file located in the `./config/` directory. **You must create this file and add your API key** like this: `GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`. This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Global Settings**: At the top of the script, you can find and modify several important defaults:\n",
    "    *   `MODEL_NAME`: We've set this to `\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"`, but you can easily switch to other models like `\"gemini-2.5-pro\"` to experiment.\n",
    "    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n",
    "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
    "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
    "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
    "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
    "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If needed, you can also check some tutorials on how a python function works: [Python Functions Tutorial](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/)"

      "1.  **Business Understanding:** Defining the problem or objective you want to achieve with data mining. What questions are you trying to answer? What business goals are you trying to meet?\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",

      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",
      "    *   **Reduction:** Reducing the size of the dataset while preserving important information.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** Selecting and applying appropriate data mining techniques (algorithms) to discover patterns. This is where the \"mining\" happens.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality and usefulness of the discovered patterns. Do they make sense? Are they statistically significant? Do they meet the business objectives?\n",

      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",
      "*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., predicting the price of a house based on its features).\n",
      "*   **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions).\n",

      "\n",
      "**Lightweight Models:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Characteristics:** Smaller in size (fewer parameters), faster inference times, lower computational requirements (CPU, GPU, RAM), and often simpler architectures.\n",
      "*   **Examples:** Mobile-optimized models (e.g., MobileNet, EfficientNet variants), models trained for specific tasks with limited data, smaller BERT variants (e.g., DistilBERT, TinyBERT).\n",
      "*   **Pros:**\n",
      "    *   **Speed:** Faster prediction and processing.\n",
      "    *   **Resource Efficiency:** Can run on less powerful hardware (edge devices, mobile phones, embedded systems).\n",
      "    *   **Cost-Effective:** Lower inference costs (cloud computing, energy consumption).\n",
      "    *   **Lower Latency:** Crucial for real-time applications.\n",
      "    *   **Easier Deployment:** Smaller models are simpler to distribute and manage.\n",
      "*   **Cons:**\n",
      "    *   **Lower Accuracy/Performance:** May sacrifice some accuracy, precision, or recall compared to larger models.\n",
      "    *   **Limited Expressiveness:** Might not capture complex patterns or nuances as effectively.\n",
      "    *   **Less Robustness:** Can be more sensitive to variations in input data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Full-Size Models:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Characteristics:** Larger in size (millions or billions of parameters), slower inference times, higher computational requirements, and often more complex, deeper architectures.\n",
      "*   **Examples:** Large language models (e.g., GPT-3, BERT-large, Llama 2), high-resolution image recognition models (e.g., ResNet-152, Inception-v4).\n",
      "*   **Pros:**\n",
      "    *   **Higher Accuracy/Performance:** Generally achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art results on complex tasks.\n",
      "    *   **Greater Expressiveness:** Can learn and represent intricate relationships and patterns in data.\n",
      "    *   **More Robustness:** Tend to be more resilient to noise and variations in input.\n",
      "    *   **Better Generalization:** Can often perform well on unseen data across a wider range of scenarios.\n",

      "    *   **High Resource Demands:** Require powerful hardware (high-end GPUs, significant RAM).\n",
      "    *   **Expensive:** Higher inference costs and substantial upfront training costs.\n",
      "    *   **Deployment Challenges:** Difficult to deploy on edge devices or in environments with limited resources.\n",
      "    *   **Higher Latency:** Not suitable for applications where immediate responses are critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How to Choose: Key Factors to Consider\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision hinges on a careful evaluation of your specific project requirements and constraints. Here are the key factors to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Application Requirements & Performance Metrics:**\n",
      "    *   **Latency Tolerance:** How quickly does your application need a response?\n",
      "        *   **Real-time/Interactive:** (e.g., chatbots, live video analysis, autonomous driving) **Strongly favors lightweight models.**\n",
      "        *   **Batch Processing/Offline Analysis:** (e.g., report generation, data summarization) **Can tolerate larger, full-size models.**\n",
      "    *   **Accuracy Needs:** What level of accuracy is acceptable?\n",
      "        *   **Mission-Critical/High Stakes:** (e.g., medical diagnosis, financial fraud detection) **May necessitate a full-size model for maximum accuracy, potentially with trade-offs in speed.**\n",
      "        *   **\"Good Enough\" for Business Value:** (e.g., content recommendation, sentiment analysis) **Lightweight models can often suffice.**\n",
      "    *   **Task Complexity:** How intricate are the patterns and relationships in your data that the model needs to capture?\n",
      "        *   **Simple Tasks:** (e.g., basic image classification on limited categories, simple text classification) **Lightweight models can be sufficient.**\n",
      "        *   **Complex Tasks:** (e.g., natural language understanding, complex object detection, image generation) **Full-size models are often required for optimal performance.**\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Resource Constraints:**\n",
      "    *   **Deployment Environment:** Where will the AI system run?\n",
      "        *   **Edge Devices (Mobile, IoT):** **Strictly lightweight models are necessary.**\n",
      "        *   **On-Premise Servers (limited hardware):** **Favor lightweight or optimized larger models.**\n",
      "        *   **Cloud Computing (scalable resources):** **Can accommodate full-size models, but cost becomes a factor.**\n",
      "    *   **Hardware Availability:** What kind of CPUs, GPUs, and RAM do you have access to for training and inference?\n",
      "    *   **Budget:** What are your financial constraints for hardware, cloud computing, and energy consumption?\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Development and Maintenance:**\n",
      "    *   **Training Time & Cost:** Full-size models require significantly more data and computational resources to train, leading to longer training times and higher costs.\n",
      "    *   **Model Size & Storage:** Larger models consume more storage space.\n",
      "    *   **Ease of Fine-tuning:** Lightweight models are generally easier and faster to fine-tune on specific downstream tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Data Availability:**\n",
      "    *   **Limited Data:** If you have a small dataset, a very large model might overfit. A smaller, more focused model might generalize better.\n",
      "    *   **Abundant Data:** With vast amounts of data, you have more room to train larger, more complex models.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strategies for Choosing:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Start Small and Scale Up:** Begin with a lightweight model. If its performance is insufficient, progressively try larger models or more complex architectures until you meet your requirements or hit resource/latency limits.\n",
      "*   **Task-Specific Optimization:** Leverage pre-trained lightweight models that are specifically designed for your task (e.g., a lightweight model for object detection on mobile).\n",
      "*   **Model Compression Techniques:** If you absolutely need the accuracy of a full-size model but have resource constraints, consider techniques like:\n",
      "    *   **Quantization:** Reducing the precision of model weights (e.g., from 32-bit to 8-bit).\n",
      "    *   **Pruning:** Removing less important connections or neurons.\n",
      "    *   **Knowledge Distillation:** Training a smaller \"student\" model to mimic the behavior of a larger \"teacher\" model.\n",
      "*   **Benchmarking:** If possible, prototype with both a lightweight and a full-size model (or a representative of each) on a subset of your data and evaluate their performance against your key metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Rule-of-Thumb:\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a practical rule-of-thumb to directly apply in real projects:\n",
      "\n",
      "**\"If your AI system needs to provide near-instantaneous responses (latency < 500ms) or run on resource-constrained devices (mobile, edge), prioritize lightweight models. Otherwise, start with a well-performing full-size model and then optimize for size and speed only if absolutely necessary for deployment or cost reasons.\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break down the application of this rule:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Scenario 1: Real-time Interaction or Edge Deployment**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Example:** A mobile app that detects emotions from facial expressions, an IoT device that alerts on anomalies, a self-driving car's perception system.\n",
      "*   **Decision:** **Favor Lightweight Models.**\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Look for models like MobileNetV3, EfficientNet-Lite, DistilBERT, or quantized versions of larger models specifically designed for mobile or edge. You might have to accept a slight dip in accuracy for the sake of real-time performance and deployability.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Scenario 2: Batch Processing or Less Time-Sensitive Applications**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Example:** Analyzing customer feedback to generate reports, summarizing documents overnight, recommending products based on historical data, image generation for marketing materials.\n",
      "*   **Decision:** **Start with a Full-Size Model (or a robust, well-established model for your task) and Optimize Later.**\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Choose a model known for high accuracy on your task (e.g., ResNet-101 for image classification, BERT-base or large for NLP tasks). Train or fine-tune it to achieve the desired accuracy.\n",
      "    *   **Then, if deployment or cost becomes an issue:**\n",
      "        1.  **Evaluate Performance Bottlenecks:** Is inference speed the problem? Or is it memory usage?\n",
      "        2.  **Apply Compression:** Try quantization, pruning, or knowledge distillation to reduce the model's size and speed up inference without a significant loss in accuracy.\n",
      "        3.  **Consider Smaller Variants:** If compression isn't enough, explore smaller, but still powerful, variants of your chosen architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why this rule-of-thumb works:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Prioritizes the most common hard constraints:** Latency and device capabilities are often non-negotiable. If you can't meet these, the system fails regardless of accuracy.\n",
      "*   **Avoids premature optimization:** For many tasks, the \"best\" full-size model offers superior accuracy that is worth the initial investment in resources. Optimizing too early can lead to suboptimal performance if the accuracy of a lightweight model was never truly tested against the \"ideal\" scenario.\n",
      "*   **Provides a clear starting point:** It gives you a definitive direction to begin your AI system development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Caveat:** This is a *rule-of-thumb*. Always validate your choice through experimentation and benchmarking against your specific project's metrics and constraints. The AI landscape is constantly evolving, so stay updated on new model architectures and optimization techniques.\n",
      "\n",

      "    *   **High Latency:** They are slow. Generating a response can take several seconds.\n",
      "    *   **Expensive:** Both training and inference (running the model) require powerful, costly GPUs (like NVIDIA H100s). API calls are also significantly more expensive.\n",
      "    *   **Resource Intensive:** They cannot run on consumer hardware like laptops or mobile phones. They require a dedicated, high-end server infrastructure.\n",

      "    *   **Low Latency:** They are incredibly fast, often providing near-instantaneous responses.\n",
      "    *   **Low Cost:** They are cheap to run, both via APIs and on self-hosted infrastructure. They can run on less powerful, more affordable hardware.\n",
      "    *   **Resource Efficient:** They can run directly **on-device** (smartphones, laptops, IoT devices), which is great for privacy, offline functionality, and avoiding network latency.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Weaknesses:**\n",
      "    *   **Lower Accuracy & Nuance:** They are more prone to errors, \"hallucinations,\" and may miss subtle context. They struggle with highly complex reasoning.\n",
      "    *   **Less Versatile:** They often need to be **fine-tuned** for a specific task to achieve high performance. Their general, zero-shot capabilities are limited.\n",
      "    *   **Limited Knowledge:** They have a smaller capacity to store and recall information compared to their larger counterparts.\n",

      "**When to Use a Lightweight Model:**\n",
      "*   Your primary goal is **speed and low cost**.\n",

      "### The \"Constraint-First\" Rule of Thumb\n",

      "Your hardest, non-negotiable requirement will point you to the right starting model.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Is your hardest constraint `RESOURCES` or `LATENCY`?**\n",
      "   *   *Examples:* The app must run on a mobile phone; the model must respond in under 300ms for a real-time UI; you need to process 1,000 requests per second on a tight budget.\n",
      "   *   **Rule:** **Start with a lightweight model.** It's often the *only* choice that can meet these constraints. Your job is then to see if you can achieve \"good enough\" accuracy through fine-tuning or prompt engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Is your hardest constraint `ACCURACY` or `COMPLEXITY`?**\n",
      "   *   *Examples:* The system diagnoses medical scans; it provides legal advice where mistakes are costly; it needs to write high-quality, complex software code.\n",
      "   *   **Rule:** **Start with a full-size model.** This is your quality benchmark. Your job is then to figure out how to manage the cost and speed, perhaps by optimizing usage, caching results, or justifying the expense with the value provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. If you have no hard constraints (the \"it depends\" zone):**\n",
      "   *   *Examples:* Building a general-purpose chatbot; summarizing articles for internal use; creating a content generation tool where both quality and cost matter.\n",
      "   *   **Rule:** **Prototype with a full-size model, but plan to deploy a lightweight one.**\n",
      "      *   **Step A (Prototype):** Use a powerful, full-size model (like GPT-4 via an API) to quickly build a proof-of-concept and prove the feature's value. This establishes your \"gold standard\" for quality.\n",
      "      *   **Step B (Production):** Once value is proven, work to replace the expensive model with a fine-tuned, cost-effective lightweight model that achieves 90-95% of the prototype's quality for a fraction of the cost and latency.\n",

    "\n",
    "The key to enabling this is to provide the model with a **response schema**. This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to.

      "I believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \n",
      "to be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \n",
      "His style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \n",
      "face, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \n",
      "example, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \n",
      "diving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \n",
      "this idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \n",
      "discovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \n",
      "themselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \n",
      "This brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \n",
      "during a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \n",
      "uninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \n",
      "travel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \n",
      "black hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \n",
      "planets. \n",
      "Throughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \n",
      "opportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \n",
      "‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \n",
      "feet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \n",
      "that a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \n",
      "increases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \n",
      "seven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \n",
      "At the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \n",
      "tesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \n",
      "which will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \n",
      "The imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \n",
      "wonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \n",
      "them to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \n",
      "bamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \n",
      "watch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \n",
      "will one day come true. \n",
      "Overall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \n",
      "another cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \n",

Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n', 'document_id': 'doc_308f32d0'}\n"

Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "\n",
    "More difficult to visually interpret at a glance.\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",

    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",

    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

Below is a detailed comparison based on the reported metrics.\n",

    "anger and joy achieve relatively better recall (0.70 and 0.85), which suggests that these emotions have clearer lexical or stylistic cues in the dataset.\n",

    "fear and sadness perform poorly, especially in recall (0.20 for both), indicating that without examples, the model cannot reliably distinguish these more subtle categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall accuracy is below 50%, showing that relying solely on the model’s general understanding is not sufficient for this task.\n",

    "anger and sadness show improved balance between precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "joy remains strong, with high recall (0.85), meaning the model internalizes the example pattern effectively.\n",

    "fear improves slightly but still remains the most difficult category (recall stays low at 0.25), likely because a single example does not sufficiently capture the diversity of fear expressions.\n",

    "provided.\n",

    "**Typical pattern:**  \n",
    "- 0-shot: wrong  \n",
    "- 1-shot: sometimes right or still wrong  \n",
    "- 5-shot: correct\n",

    "**Observations:**  \n",
    "- Most improvements happened for *joy* and *sadness*, which appear visually and\n",
    "linguistically ambiguous in short social media texts.  \n",
    "- Adding examples helps the model learn subtle cues such as emojis, sarcasm,\n",
    "or tone indicators (e.g., “lol”, “finally”, “so happy”).\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that **in-context learning effectively provides the model with\n",
    "structured emotional cues**, reducing ambiguity.\n",

    "## **2. Cases where performance does not improve**\n",
    "These are examples where all predictions remained wrong across 0-shot, 1-shot,\n",

    "\n",
    "**Typical causes:**\n",
    "- Mixed emotional content (“I’m upset but also relieved”).\n",
    "- Context missing (tweets replying to something else).\n",
    "- Sarcasm, where literal keywords contradict the true label.\n",
    "- Very short texts with no clear emotional markers (“great”, “wow”, “idk”).\n",

    "ironically toned texts remain difficult even with examples.\n",

    "## **3. Cases where performance gets worse with more examples**\n",
    "These are examples where:\n",
    "- 0-shot predictions were correct,\n",
    "- but 1-shot or 5-shot predictions were wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible reasons:**\n",
    "- **Overfitting to the demonstrations** (model tries too hard to match the\n",
    "patterns in the examples).\n",
    "- **Examples contain strong emotion-specific keywords**, causing the model to\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Summary**\n",

    "from in-context examples.\n",

It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
